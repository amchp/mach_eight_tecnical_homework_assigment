# Solution
In the solution first I read the argument from the command line. Then, I use the urllib and json to download the json file from the internet and extract the values into something I can manipulate. After, I go through each players information and add them to a list dictionary based on their height. Then, I check in the dictionary if there are any heights that summed with this player's height equal the inputed value. If so I add this to the output. Finally, I print the output. The complexity of this algoritm is O(nlog(n)) in the avarage case because it goes through the list of players once and it searches a dictionary with players in each search. In the worst case the complexity is O(n^2) but this is unavoidable because all the players have the same height and each pair sums to the inputed value to print the output it would take O(n^2) time.
